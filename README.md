# Game-of-Life

## Description

Conway game of life Visualizer is a Python application for simulating [Conway's Game of Life][wikipedia game of life] Conway's Game of Life that allows you to perform a cellular automata simulation on saved or personnalized configurations.

## Requirements

- Python version 3 (latest one is prefered)

It works on Linux and Windows Operating systems

## Features

- You can define your own configuration
- You can change the configuration (add or remove cells) while the simulation is running
- You can save/load configurations in/from CSV files
- You can Save current configuration as PDF/PS files
- You can customize your simulation by changing the shape of the cells: square, circle, triangle
- You can customize your simulation by changing the color of the cells, the grid, and the background
- You can select a zone and do one of the actions:
    - Fill the zone with cells
    - Remove all the cells in the zone
    - Copy then paste the content of the zone
    - Save the zone as a PDF/PS files
- You can run the simulation step by step
- You can change the speed of the simulation while it's running

## List of shortcut

- ** Simulation **
    - `<Enter>`: Start/Stop the simulation
    - `<n>`, `<N>`, `<Right>`: next step
